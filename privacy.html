<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> March 2025</p>

<p>
Parked Car Finder respects your privacy. This application is designed to work
entirely on your device and does not collect, transmit, or store any personal
data on external servers.
</p>

<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

<p>
Parked Car Finder does <strong>not</strong> collect, share, or sell any personal
or sensitive user data. All information used by the app remains locally on
your device.
</p>

<h2>Permissions Used</h2>

<p>
The app requests the following permissions strictly to provide its core
functionality:
</p>

<h3>Location (Precise and Approximate)</h3>
<p>
Location access is used solely to save your parked car's location on your own
device so you can navigate back to it later. This location data is stored
locally on your phone and is never transmitted, shared, or uploaded anywhere.
</p>

<h3>Foreground Service</h3>
<p>
A foreground service is used to keep a parking timer running while the app is
not in the foreground. This allows the app to accurately track parking duration
and calculate parking cost without interruption.
</p>

<h3>Notifications</h3>
<p>
Notification permission allows the app to display an ongoing notification while
parking is active. This notification shows your parking status and estimated
cost so you can check it at a glance without opening the app.
</p>

<h2>Data Storage</h2>

<p>
All data related to your parking session (location, start time, and rate) is
stored locally on your device. The app does not use cloud storage, analytics
services, advertising SDKs, or third-party trackers.
</p>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>

<p>
Parked Car Finder does not share any data with third parties.
</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

<p>
This app does not knowingly collect any personal information from children.
</p>

<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be
reflected on this page with an updated revision date.
</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>

<p>
If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, you may contact
the developer via the app store listing.
